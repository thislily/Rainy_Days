        <h2>Pushing the Comfort Zone</h2>
        <p>
          In 1997, a group of outdoor enthusiasts and environmentalists came
          together to create a new kind of outerwear company, one that would
          prioritize sustainability and eco-friendliness in all aspects of its
          operations. They called their company Rainy Days.
        </p>

        <img

          src="/images/our-story/our-story-mobile-2.png"
          alt="A man wearing a hiking jacket, sitting on a log in forest."
        />

        <p>
          Rainy Days' founders believed that clothing could be both functional
          and environmentally conscious, and they set out to prove it. They
          sourced materials from sustainable and ethical suppliers, used
          recycled and organic fabrics whenever possible, and designed their
          products to last for years rather than just a season.
        </p>
        <p>
          At first, Rainy Days struggled to find a foothold in the competitive
          outerwear market. But as more and more consumers became aware of the
          environmental impact of fast fashion and disposable clothing, Rainy
          Days' message began to resonate.

        <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
        <p>
          By the early 2000s, Rainy Days had become a leading brand in
          sustainable outerwear. They partnered with environmental organisations
          to raise awareness and funds for conservation efforts, and their
          products were worn by outdoor enthusiasts and eco-conscious consumers
          alike.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Rainy Days continues to innovate in sustainable design and is
          recognised as a leader in environmentally friendly outerwear. Their
          commitment to the planet remains at the heart of everything they do.
