     <h2 id="maintenance">Fabric Care and Maintenance</h2>
     <p>Proper maintenance of hiking jackets is essential to ensure their longevity and effectiveness in protecting you from the elements. Firstly, always follow the care instructions on the label. Before washing, zip up all zippers and close all Velcro tabs to prevent damage to the fabric. Use a mild detergent, and avoid fabric softeners and bleach. Wash the jacket on a gentle cycle in cold water, and hang it to dry, avoiding direct sunlight or high heat. If the jacket has a waterproof membrane, use a special detergent and reapply the DWR (Durable Water Repellent) coating as needed. Regularly check for any tears, holes or signs of wear, and repair them promptly to prevent further damage. By taking good care of your hiking jacket, it will last longer and continue to serve you well on all your outdoor adventures.</p>

     <span class="line"></span>
     <h2 id="repairs">DIY Repairs</h2>
     <p>Repairing jackets yourself is a great way to save money and extend the lifespan of your gear. For small tears or holes, you can use a patch or repair tape to cover them. To repair a ripped seam, turn the jacket inside out, and use a needle and thread to stitch it back together. For a broken zipper, you can purchase a replacement zipper and replace it yourself by carefully removing the old zipper and sewing in the new one. When repairing your jacket, be sure to use the correct tools and materials, and take your time to ensure a neat and sturdy repair. However, for more significant repairs or if you are unsure of how to proceed, it's best to take your jacket to a professional tailor or outdoor gear repair specialist.</p>
